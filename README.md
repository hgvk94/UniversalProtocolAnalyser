# UniversalProtocolAnalyser
Serial communication between embedded systems follow many different protocols. It can be a hefty task to check each and every system individually when building a large system. The project aims to ease this pain by leaving the testing part to a separate module.


Consider the scenario when you try to create a mobile tracker device. You need to integrate a GPS module, a GSM module and then some motion trackers with your embedded system. Based on the manufacturer, these use different protocols to talk with each other. A hardware, in system debugger (whose schematics will be uploaded soon) will help you a lot under such a circumstance. The project aims to develop the source code for the debugger.
